# COP3530_Final
This was a group final project for COP3530 - Algorithms and Data Structures at UF. 
Project was written in C++.
The premise of the project was to create a program that uses two sorting 
structers to sort through 100,000 data points of our choosing. 
My group decided to create a project that sorts through 
drug data (the data is given in the excel spreadsheet attatched) 
to educate the user on the increasing cases of drug abuse. 
The user can sort through different categories such as age, gender, type of drug, etc.
